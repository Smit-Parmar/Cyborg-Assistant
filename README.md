# Cyborg-Assistant
I have created my own virtual assistant using python and its name is cyborg.
Cyborg can do certain task for you like...
1. Play music
2. Open youtube
3. Search wikipedia
4. Interection 
5. Open file from pc etc
to perform all the above task you have to give location of the file to code which you want to open by saying command "Open file".
